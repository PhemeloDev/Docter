# Image Placeholders

This directory contains placeholder images for the Doctor Consultation App POC. In a production environment, you would replace these with actual images for:

- Doctor profiles (doctor-1.jpg, doctor-2.jpg, etc.)
- Testimonial user images (testimonial-1.jpg, testimonial-2.jpg, etc.)
- Hero section images (doctor-video-call.jpg)
- Service icons and other UI elements

For development and testing, you can use image placeholder services like:

1. https://placehold.co/ - Example: `https://placehold.co/400x600/blue/white?text=Doctor+Image`
2. https://placeholder.com/ - Example: `https://via.placeholder.com/400x600.png?text=Doctor+Image`
3. https://picsum.photos/ - For random images: `https://picsum.photos/400/600`

When implementing the app in production, ensure all images are optimized for web use and properly sized to reduce load times.
